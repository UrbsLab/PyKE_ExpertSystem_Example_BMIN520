# PyKE_ExpertSytem_Example_BMIN520
Example PyKE code and Jupyter Notebook for a simple backwards chaining expert system as described in this lecture on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzsk5_EmZq8

We recommend first opening and reading through the 'BMIN 520- PyKE Installation and Family Relations Example' Jupyter Notebook to understand how to install and use PyKE as well as confirm that it is working properly on your computer. 

Next open 'BMIN 520 - PyKE Coding Simple Example' to run the very simple backwards chaining expert system implemented as an example for the course. 

The relevant code for that expert system are within the folder 'simple_bc_all'.
