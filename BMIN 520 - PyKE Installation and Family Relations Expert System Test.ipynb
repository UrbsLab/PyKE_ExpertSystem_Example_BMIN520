    "## Subtask 1 - Install PyKE:\n",
    "- PyKE is an expert system interpreter and coding framework that we will use in this course to learn how to build and run a simple expert system.  PyKE was chosen because it operates exclusively in Python (and unlike PyCLIPS, it works in Python 3). Probably the most commonly used expert system framework today is called CLIPS, however this is a C coding language interpreted system. If you want to (optionally) check out CLIPS, see the link below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Link: CLIPS website http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the Python expert system framework called Pyke (for Python 3.7).  Pyke stands for Python Knowledge Engine. For general information and background on Pyke check out the link below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Link: Pyke information page and tutorials http://pyke.sourceforge.net/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The information at the above link may be helpful when completing problems involving PyKE below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation Instructions\n",
    "1. Download pyke3-1.1.1.zip from https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyke/files/pyke/1.1.1/\n",
    "2. Unzip pyke3-1.1.1.zip (if you are unfamiliar with how to unzip a file see https://www.wikihow.com/Unzip-a-File)\n",
    "3. Check the unzipped folder to ensure its contents include folders by the name of (build, doc, examples, experimental, pyke, Test) along with a number of other files including README.txt. (Note when working with newly installed code, the README file includes important information on how to get started with and run the code) \n",
    "4. Copy the folder with these PyKE files to where ever you wish to work from (i.e. your working directory).\n",
    "5. Open your computer's command line (outside of this notebook) and navigate to the location of the copied PyKE folder (i.e. within the folder pyke-1.1.1 that contains the file 'setup'.\n",
    "6. Run the following commands (one at a time) in your command line to build and install PyKE:\n",
    "    - <font color='green'>python setup.py build  </font>  \n",
    "    - <font color='green'>python setup.py install  </font>  \n",
    "7. Take a look at the pyke example folder '/examples/family_relations/'.\n",
    "    - Within that folder you should see 7 files including '<font color='green'>driver.py </font> '\n",
    "        - There are three kinds of Pyke source files:\n",
    "            - .kfb files define fact bases\n",
    "            - .krb files define rule bases\n",
    "            - .kqb files define question bases\n",
    "    - Open and read the README files in this family_relations folder for an explanation of the different files and a set of examples that may be run. \n",
    "8. Copy your unique path to this '/family_relations/' into the 'sys.path.append()' command in subtask 3.  I've left how I did this on my computer as an example.\n",
    "7. If these steps have been completed successfully then you should be able to run the commands in the cells below..."
